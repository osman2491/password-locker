##Project overveiw

It becomes really hard to remember all those 
passwords and create new ones for all apps we use.
 This app helps a user save and generate passwords.

#Description

This project lets a user save login credentials for 
any application. Once they create a username and 
password they can add an app and the program saves 
the credentials. One has the choice to either input
 their own password or opt for a system generated 
 one. A user can also delete an existing entry.

#User story

The user would like to..

1. create a password locker account with my details, a
 login username and password.
 2. store my already existing account credentials in 
 the application. Assuming I already have a twitter 
 account, I want to store my already existing twitter
  username and password in the application.
3. create new account credentials in the application. 
For example, if I have not yet signed up for 
Instagram, I would want to create a credentials 
account for Instagram in the application and the
 application generates a password for me to use when 
 I sign up for Instagram.
 4. have the option of putting in a password that I 
 want to use for the new credential account. For 
 example, when creating my Instagram credential 
 account, I want to have an option of putting in the
  password I want to use instead of having the 
  application generate a password for me.
  5. view my various account credentials and their 
  passwords in the application.
  6. Delete a credentials account that I no longer 
  need in the application.
